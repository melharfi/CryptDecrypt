# CryptDecrypt
Tool to crypt / decrypt assets for MELHARFI game engine

Hi there, using my 2d game engine to develop my current game, an RPG network 
https://github.com/melharfi/MELHARFI-2D-Game-Engine

I need to protect its assets, so i build a small tool that use Rijndael AES encrypted algorithm

here is how to use it :

Just launch the program and click "Find ..." , and then look for your asset(s) in your hard drive.

Then you need to choose betwine 2 encrypting options,

1 giving your own keys (First Key and IV (second key) which they are a string of 8 character each one
2 generate a keys (more complicated)

By the way, you can select many files in the same time, or even select a directory, then same parameters will be done for them all.

**Decrypt**

To decrypt the file, just select your file(s) by "Find ..." button and then click "Decrypt" tab and type your key & IV and Decrypt them.

Notice that a new file is generated when encrypting or decrypting file as the original remain the same to avoid any corruption or damaged source

If you like the tool give buy me a coffe : paypal m.elharfi@gmail.com
